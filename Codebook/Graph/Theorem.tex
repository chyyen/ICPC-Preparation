\begin{itemize}

\item Kosaraju's algorithm visit the strong connected components in topolocical order at second dfs.

\item Euler's formula on planar graph:  $V - E + F = C + 1$

\item Kuratowski's theorem: A simple graph $G$ is a planar graph iff $G$ doesn't has a subgraph $H$ such that $H$ is homeomorphic to $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$

\item A complement set of every vertex cover correspond to a independent set. $\Rightarrow$ Number of vertex of maximum independent set $+$ Number of vertex of minimum vertex cover $= \lvert V \rvert$

\item Maximum independent set of $G =$ Maximum clique of the complement graph of $G$ . 

\item A planar graph $G$ colored with three colors iff there exist a maximal clique $I$ such that $G - I$ is a bipartite. 

\end{itemize}
