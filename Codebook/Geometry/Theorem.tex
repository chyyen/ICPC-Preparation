\begin{itemize}
\item Pick's theorem: Suppose that a polygon has integer coordinates for all of its vertices. Let 
$i$ be the number of integer points interior to the polygon, $b$ be the number of integer points on its boundary (including both vertices and points along the sides). Then the area $A$ of this polygon is:
$$ A = i + \frac{b}{2} - 1$$
\end{itemize}
